To run the main program enter the folder PROGRAM. Run the command:
make

All old files will be removed, the c files will be compiled and the program will run all tests. 
IMPORTANT: This program is created and run on a linux computer. 

For changing the algorithm stratedy, go into the makefile and change the value of the variable DSTRATEGY to:
1 for first_fit
2 for best_fit
3 for worst_fit
4 for quick_fit


To run our own tests go into the folder TIME or MEMORY. Set DSTRATEGY to the desired value and run the command:
make 1

â€¦ And the edited test versions of tstalgorithms will run and print the results.
